#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure
# out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks
# for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person
# who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's
# mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the
# dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find
# the most prolific committer.
