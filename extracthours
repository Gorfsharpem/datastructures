10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the
#distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
#You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then
#splitting the string a second time using a colon.
#From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
#Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour,
#print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

fname=input("Enter the file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
mydict=dict()
mylist=list()
count=0

for line in fh:
    if  not line.startswith('From '):
        continue

    ls=line.split()
    ls1=ls[5]
    ls2=ls1.split(':')
    hrs=ls2[0]
    mylist.append(hrs)
for word in mylist:
    mydict[word]=mydict.get(word,0) +1
    #print(line)
anotherlist=list()
for k,v in mydict.items():
    tupp=(k,v)
    anotherlist.append(tupp)
    #print(tupp)
anotherlist=sorted(anotherlist)
for k1,v1 in anotherlist[:10]:

    print(k1,v1)


#print(mydict.items())
#here the tuples/in terms of dictionary is ready. You need to reverse the order of keys and
#print out the dictionary
